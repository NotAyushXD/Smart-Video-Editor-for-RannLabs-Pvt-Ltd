Developed a complete client-based Python application which is used to edit and save snippets of the videos, this can
be used to collect data for a Machine learning application. 

We have done 2 implementations of this project based on the clients reqirements.

For implementation 1
Run "VideoEditor_FINAL.py"

For implementation 2
Run "IMPLEMENTATION 2/VideoEditor_ working_30thmarch_with_screenshot.py"

The above implementations are implemented by using different libraries based on python.
